# FightingForOnePiece_Recomp

**A native Linux port of *Fighting for One Piece* (NTSC-J, `SLPS-25545`), made by statically recompiling the game's PlayStation 2 code to C++.**<br>
Not an emulator: the game's own MIPS R5900 code, rebuilt as a native program on a reimplementation of the PS2 hardware.

## Status

**Playable.** From the title screen through the main menu, character select and VS screen into 3D fights (Fighting
Mode against the CPU, rounds, special moves and their cut-ins), with music and sound effects, at a steady 60 game
frames per second. It runs on PS2Recomp's native target: the GS is translated to OpenGL at twice the PS2's resolution
instead of being emulated, the game's 14 IOP modules are recompiled to C++ (none left to the interpreter), and the
sound runs on the PC's clock. VS Fight, Gamble, Training and the options reach their screens, and the memory card
saves and loads the game's data. Movies are skipped.

## How it works

```

                                  │

   PS2Recomp runtime: EE kernel HLE · DMAC · GIF → GS on OpenGL · VIF/VU0/VU1 ─┼─► ps2EntryRunner
   PS2Recomp IOP:     the game's own IRX, recompiled · SPU2 on the PC clock · SIO2
```

- The ELF has no symbols. `ps2_analyzer` maps the functions and binds the SCE SDK ones it recognises to the runtime's
  handlers.
- PS2Recomp turns every function into C++. The VU1 microcode found in the ELF is compiled ahead of time by
  `ps2_vu_aot`; microcode loaded from the data archive runs in the interpreter. The IOP modules are dumped as the
  IOP loads them and recompiled the same way (`scripts/recomp_iop.sh`).
- The GS is not emulated: its drawing state and primitives become OpenGL draws into GPU render targets
  (PS2Recomp's GS native back end), rendered at 2x.
- `runtime/ffop_overrides.cpp` holds the game-specific bindings, matched to the ELF by entry point and CRC.

The runtime is the `PS2Recomp/` git submodule: [boubou666/PS2Recomp](https://github.com/boubou666/PS2Recomp), branch
`native/renderer`, shared with the *Soulcalibur III*, *Twisted Metal:
Black*, *Valkyrie Profile 2: Silmeria*, *The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age*, *Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament 2*
and *Drakengard* recompilations. The top-level `CMakeLists.txt` builds its runtime, swaps its placeholder function
table for the generated one and links the generated code, `runtime/`, the compiled VU1 microcode and the recompiled
IOP modules into `ps2EntryRunner`. Generic fixes go to boubou666's `native/*` branches, merged into `native/renderer`.

## Requirements

- Linux (developed on Arch)
- CMake 3.21+, Ninja, Clang with C++20, rsync, and bsdtar (libarchive) to extract the disc
- FFmpeg development libraries (`libavcodec`, `libavformat`, `libavutil`, `libswresample`, `libswscale`)
- X11/Wayland and OpenGL development headers (raylib is fetched and built by the runtime), a GPU with OpenGL 4.5
- Your own copy of `SLPS-25545` as a disc image (the extracted ELF is checked against the hash above)

## Build and run

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Arzaroth/FightingForOnePiece_Recomp.git
cd FightingForOnePiece_Recomp
scripts/extract_iso.sh "/path/to/Fighting for One Piece (Japan).iso"   # disc files -> game/
scripts/build_tools.sh                                                  # ps2_recomp, ps2_analyzer, ps2_vu_aot -> build/tools
scripts/recomp.sh                                                       # game/SLPS_255.45 + recomp/ffop.toml -> generated/
scripts/compile_vu1.sh                                                  # VU1 microcode in the ELF -> generated/vu1/
scripts/build_runtime.sh                                                # runtime + generated code -> build/game (RelWithDebInfo)
scripts/recomp_iop.sh                                                   # one boot dumps the IOP modules -> generated/iop/
scripts/build_runtime.sh                                                # again, with the recompiled IOP modules
scripts/run.sh                                                          # ps2EntryRunner game/SLPS_255.45
```

The game runs on PS2Recomp's native target by default: the GS translated to OpenGL (`PS2X_GS_RENDERER=native`) at
twice the PS2's resolution (`PS2X_GS_SCALE=2`),
the IOP modules recompiled (`PS2X_IOP_NATIVE=1`), the SPU2 and the IOP on the host clock (`PS2X_SPU2_WALLCLOCK=1`,
`PS2X_IOP_WALLCLOCK=1`). Export any of them to change it, e.g. `PS2X_GS_RENDERER=cpu` for the CPU GS. Without
`scripts/recomp_iop.sh` the IOP interprets its modules as before.

The extracted disc folder is the game's `cdrom0:`; the memory cards (`mc0/`, `mc1/`) are created next to the ELF in
`game/`. `scripts/analyze.sh` reruns `ps2_analyzer` into `build/analyzer.toml`; `recomp/ffop.toml` started from that
output and is edited by hand, so merge new analyzer output into it rather than replacing it.

`JOBS=<n>` sets the build parallelism of every script (default: all cores). `scripts/build_runtime.sh Release` or
`Debug` picks another build type, and `CXX` another compiler (Clang is used when it is installed).
`scripts/ffoprun.sh <name> <seconds> [VAR=value...]` runs the game for that long with a state dump every 5 seconds,
logs to `build/runs/<name>.log` and screenshots the window.
